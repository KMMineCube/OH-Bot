options = arguments in discord slash command

Main change: Use the new Discord Bot GUIs to make it easier for students to choose a course to join a queue for

1. Allow students to get notified when a tutor opens a queue, for a particular course
    - students can type a command like /pingwhenopen [CourseName]
    - options:
        > don't ping after [set amount of time]
    - note: does not "pre-queue" the stutent in the queue. Students will still have to manually add themselves to 
        the queue
        > default set to end of the day (PST/PDT)
    - recommend students to allow direct messages from the bot and to disable do not disturb mode so that they will
        get a notification

2. View next tutoring hours for a certain course/office hours
    - /whennext [CourseName]
    - options:

3. Allowing multiple people to join the vc
    - /enqueue will have a new option called: "one-on-one"
        > bool value
        > if set to true, then restrict the 
        > default is set to false

4. add option "queue_name" to the /leave command incase someone is queued for multiple courses at once and 
    only wants to queue out of one

5. change /clear to require a queue_name

6. when student leaves the vc 
    - send student a ping asking to put a comment in their code
    - send student a feeback form and ask the student to fill it

7. print both username and nickname in the queue (queue.ts, HelpQueueDisplayManager::GetQueueText(), line 23)
    - e.g.:
        > 1. Kaoushik (KMMineCube#3702) // for those with nicks
        > 2. UCDavisStudent#1234        // for those without nicks

8. Printing data from google sheets to discord via bot (only for tutors)
    a) hours spent this week
    b) hours remaining this week to complete the requirement
    c) number of students helped
    d) list of students helped from newest to oldest (helps with reminding people to add comments to their code)

9. Notifying tutor when person joins a queue (queue.ts, HelpQueue::Enqueue(), line 109)
    - currently only notifies when queue goes from empty to having people
    - add an option to allow tutors to get pinged either the same way as before or each time a person joins the queue

10. unimplemented features? 
    - How long a student has been waiting in the queue (member_state_manager.ts, GetWaitTime, line 46)
    - How long a student was helped (member_state_manager.ts, GetHelpTime, line 80)
        > might be the time that's shown when you do /list_helpers
